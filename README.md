## It's Just a Phase Project

The It's Just a Phase Project aims to analyze data concerning the rights of the LGBT+ community worldwide, with two primary objectives:

  1. Presenting the condition of the community from both a diachronic (over time) and synchronic (at a specific point in time) perspective.
  2. Comparing the level of rights of the LGBT+ community with the democracy index of various countries.

### Research Questions

  1. What is the current state of LGBT+ community rights worldwide?
  2. How have these rights changed over the last thirty years?
  3. What is the correlation between a country's democracy index and its level of protection and acknowledgment of queer rights?

### The Dataset

The data about LGBT rights were collected from Our World in Data. The dataset consists of several CSV files.

The dataset can be divided into three main subgroups:

 a. Civil Union for Same-Sex Partners

This subgroup measures if civil unions for same-sex partners are adopted, considering various indicators such as population coverage, gender scope, punishment levels, ease of access, and evidence of enforcement.
 
 b. LGBT+ Rights Index

This index measures a countryâ€™s LGBT+ policy landscape by capturing the implementation of 18 different LGBT+ policies. It includes both progressive and regressive policies, with scores ranging from -5 to +13.
 
 c. Marriage for Same-Sex Partners Banned

This subgroup measures if same-sex marriages are banned, considering similar indicators as the Civil Union subgroup.

### 3. Visualization

Both static visualizations (using Matplotlib and Seaborn) and dynamic visualizations (using Dash and Folium) were utilized to present the analysis results effectively.

### 4. Conclusions

From this analysis, several key findings emerge:

  - Improving Global Protection: Overall, there is a trend of improving protection of gay rights on a global scale. This suggests progress in legal and societal recognition of LGBT+ individuals.

  - Regional Variations: Despite global progress, some countries exhibit a worsening trend in the protection of gay rights. These disparities highlight the importance of targeted advocacy efforts in regions facing regression.

  - Correlation with Political Regime: While there is a correlation between gay discrimination and political regime, it appears to be relatively weak. This suggests that while political factors may influence the level of protection afforded to LGBT+ individuals, other societal and cultural dynamics also play significant roles.
